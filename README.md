 . Web - Frontend Portfolio

The main frontend website for [kubelab.live](https://kubelab.live) - my personal portfolio and landing page. Built with Astro for maximum performance and developer experience.

 What it is

This is my personal website where I showcase my portfolio, share downloadable resources, and provide information about what I do. I chose Astro because it handles SSR and SSG perfectly, it's fast, and doesn't ship unnecessary JavaScript to users.

The site includes my portfolio projects, lead magnets like DevOps checklists, newsletter signup forms, and contact information - all integrated with my Go API backend.

 Tech stack

- Astro .. - Modern meta-framework for content-focused sites
- TypeScript - Static typing for better development experience  
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- MDX - Markdown with JSX for dynamic content creation
- Docker - Containerized for consistent deployment

 Design system

I use Tailwind with custom configurations:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.mjs
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          : 'effff',
          : 'bf',
          : 'eaa'
        }
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

 Reusable components

```astro
---
// src/components/ui/Button.astro
interface Props {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}

const { variant = 'primary', size = 'md' } = Astro.props;
---

<button 
  class:list={[
    'font-semibold rounded-lg transition-colors',
    {
      'bg-primary- text-white hover:bg-primary-': variant === 'primary',
      'bg-gray- text-gray- hover:bg-gray-': variant === 'secondary',
      'px- py- text-sm': size === 'sm',
      'px- py-': size === 'md',
      'px- py- text-lg': size === 'lg'
    }
  ]}
>
  <slot />
</button>
```

 Analytics and tracking

The website includes comprehensive tracking:

- Google Analytics - Traffic and user behavior analysis
- Form tracking - Download and conversion metrics
- Newsletter metrics - Subscription rates and sources
- Core Web Vitals - Performance monitoring

 Security measures

- Server-side validation - All forms validate through the API
- Security headers - CSP, HSTS, and other protection headers
- Rate limiting - Prevents form spam and abuse
- Input sanitization - All user input is cleaned and validated

 SEO optimization

- Dynamic meta tags - Each page has unique titles and descriptions
- Structured data - JSON-LD for better search engine understanding
- Automatic sitemap - Generated during build process
- Canonical URLs - Prevents duplicate content issues
- Image alt text - Accessibility and SEO compliance

 API integration

Forms connect to my Go API backend:

```typescript
// Newsletter subscription
POST /api/subscribe
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "tags": ["newsletter", "website"]
}

// Resource download
POST /api/lead-magnet  
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "resource_id": "devops-checklist",
  "utm_source": "website"
}

// Contact form
POST /api/contact
{
  "name": "Name",
  "email": "email@example.com", 
  "message": "The message"
}
```
